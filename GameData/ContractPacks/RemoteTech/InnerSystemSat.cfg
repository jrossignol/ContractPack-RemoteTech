    title = Communication satellite for inner planets
    description = We'd like to know what's out there, and the first step is setting up a satellite or two with one of the new larger dishes.
    synopsis = Launch a satellite with enough range for the inner planets and point it towards one of them.  Make sure it has connectivity back to mission control.
    completedMessage = The satellite is up and transmitting, and our shake-out testing is complete!
